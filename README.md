# HWID-BETA
 Counter Strike 1.6 HWID Ban system (beta)


Task 1: Research and Develop HWID Retrieval Method

- Investigate Windows API calls to retrieve client's HWID (e.g., disk serial number, motherboard ID, etc.)
- Develop a custom solution to retrieve HWID information, as no third-party library is available
- Implement the HWID retrieval method in Pawn language


Task 2: Design and Implement Database Storage

Choose a suitable database management system (e.g., SQLite) for storing HWIDs
Design the database schema to store HWIDs and associated ban information
Implement database storage and retrieval functions in Pawn language


Task 3: Implement Ban Checking Logic

Develop a function to query the database and check if the client's HWID is banned
Handle cases where the HWID is not found in the database (e.g., first-time connection)
Implement logic to update the database when a client is banned or unbanned


Task 4: Develop HWID Change Detection and Prevention

Implement measures to detect and prevent HWID spoofing (e.g., checking for inconsistencies in the HWID)
Handle cases where a client's HWID changes (e.g., due to hardware upgrades or replacements)


Task 5: Integrate with Counter-Strike 1.6

Use AMX Mod X to integrate the HWID ban system with the game
Implement functionality to ban clients when their HWID is found in the database
Display a ban message or notification to the client
Prevent banned clients from connecting to the server


Task 6: Ensure Security and Privacy

Implement measures to ensure the security and privacy of stored HWIDs (e.g., encryption)
Consider data breach prevention measures to protect the database


Task 7: Test and Refine

Thoroughly test the HWID ban system to ensure it works correctly and doesn't cause issues with the game or other plugins
Refine the system to handle edge cases and improve its performance


By following these tasks, you'll be able to create a robust HWID ban system for Counter-Strike 1.6 using AMX Mod X and the Pawn language. Good luck with your project!
